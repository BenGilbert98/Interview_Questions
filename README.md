# Agile and Scrum
## What are agile and scrum
- Agile is a methodology which utilises core values or principles to help increase the efficiency of a project by breaking tasks down into smaller, more consumable increments. I have used agile throughout my training at Sparta in order to maximise the amount of learning we can do by breaking topics down into small sub sections. The result of which is more efficient teaching and learning for each topic.
- Scrum is a framework which is used to help bring teams together by encouraging learning through experiences and reflection upon wins and losses during a sprint in order to keep improving. We have implemented a scrum framework into our daily routine by having a

- Sprint plan at the start of the week on Trello to show what will be learned through the weeklong sprint
- Daily stand-ups in the mornings to find any initial problems and reflect upon what we enjoyed on the previous day.
- Retrospective in the form on 1 to 1 interview at the end of the sprint to catch up on progress and reflect on the week.

## Difference between agile and scrum
The main difference between agile and scrum is that agile is a methodology which employs a core set of principles whereas scrum is a specific agile framework which is used to facilitate a project.

## Agile values and principles:
1.	Individuals and interactions over processes and tools.
2.	Working software over comprehensive documentation.
3.	Customer collaboration over contract negotiation.
4.	Responding to change over following a plan.

## 3 amigos:
The three amigos are businesses analyst, developer and tester. The principle of the three amigos is that all three of these roles should be present within a meeting  so that the business, quality assurance and development aspects of the task and team can be discussed in one sitting. The objective of this is to bridge the gap and improve understanding between the departments 
Scrum Roles
- Scrum Master – responsible for holding the team together and ensuring that the scrum is being completed to a high standard. They also help the development team to manage blockers and get tasks done.
- Product Owner – the business is represented by the product owner who is responsible for prioritizing the features which the development team will deliver. 
- Development Team – comprised of designers, writers,  programmers and engineers, they are responsible for developing the project and completing the work required to deliver the product.

## Scrum Artefacts
- Product backlog – this is the work that will be completed in order to meet the DoD and is compiled from multiple sources like user stories, customer support and business analysis
- Sprint backlog – a set of product backlog tasks which will be developed during the sprint.
- Product Increment – customer deliverables that were produced by completing the product backlog tasks during a sprint 

## Scrum Ceremonies
- Sprint planning – occurs at the beginning of a sprint. Here, each item in the product backlog will be discussed with a time estimation for each item. A forecast will then be outlined predicting how many items will be delivered within the sprint
- Daily Stand-up – quick meeting at the start of the day to inform everyone of what is going on within the team in a light but fun tone. Should be focused on what was completed, what will be worked on and blockers
- Iteration review – a showcase of the team’s work, usually in a casual format, used to celebrate accomplishments and get immediate feedback.
- Retrospective – a reflection of the work done in the sprint, used to help the team understand what worked well and what didn’t and provides an opportunity to learn from any mistakes

## Sprint
A sprint is a period of time within a scrum where the team will work to complete a specified amount of work set by the scrum master. The purpose of a sprint is to help the team ship better software to the users. 

## Personas
Personas are detailed, synthetic biographies of fictitious users of the future product and are used to represent certain categories of people who might be using your product. They provide designers and developers with an anchor for justifying design choices and help weight certain decisions towards the target demographics.

## V-model, Agile and Waterfall – difference between them and use cases
### V-model
The main idea in the V-Model is that development tasks and testing tasks are corresponding activities of equal importance, which is symbolized by the two sides of the V. The model moves from right to left with business requirements and design processes being done on the left side and testing and debugging happening on the right hand side. The V model is useful for small to medium projects where the requirements are defined and fixed. Similarly, enough technical knowledge and resources are required. Since no prototypes are produced, this is a high risk model to use.
### Agile
Agile is a methodology which utilises core values or principles to help increase the efficiency of a project by breaking tasks down into smaller, more consumable increments. Agile is used when there are unclear requirements, a need to implement changes or when user needs are assumed to be changing.
### Waterfall
The idea of waterfall is that you complete the project one development level at a time before the next is initiated. A review takes place to determine if the project is on the right path and whether or not to continue or discard the project. Waterfall is used for short projects, where the product definition is stable and where the requirements are well known and fixed.

# SQL questions
## What is a foreign key?
A foreign key is a key which refers to the primary key of another table and is often used to link two tables together.

## What is DML and DDL?
DML stands for data manipulation language and encompasses queries which are used to add, retrieve or update data
DDL is data definition language and is the language used to create database schema and define some constraints. It encompasses create, drop, rename and alter



# Python questions
## What is OOP and what are the four pillars?
OOP is object oriented programming
- Abstraction – this allows only essential features of an object to be shown to the user.
- Encapsulation – means packaging data and member functions together within a class.
- Inheritance – The ability to create a new class from an existing class. This allows the properties and methods to be acquired by the child class and is useful for reusing existing code.
- Polymorphism – the ability for a subclass to have its own unique attributes and method while still being able to inherit from a parent class

## When you implemented OOP? (STAR)
During our python weeks, we utilised OOP in a number of tasks one of which was a DNA string parsing task. In this task we had to iterate through a string made up of A, T, C, G and return the count of each letter. OOP was used here successfully to create a list class and then a count class which were executed within a main file.
Another instance of OOP was in our bank account task where we had to create accounts with attributes and methods to withdraw, deposit and apply bank fees. Here, OOP was useful because many attributes and methods were shared by multiple classes and so to improve the DRYness and quality of our code it was beneficial to employ OOP.

## What is TDD and how have you used it?
TDD is test driven development and is a process that relies on test cases being produced before the software is fully developed then building the code to satisfy those tests. One example where we have used TDD within our learning was for the bread factory task where we had to define functions to make dough, bake dough and run factory. Here, TDD was used to make sure that these functions returned their expected values when specific inputs were used. After which, the classes and functions were defined. 









# DevOps
## What is DevOps?
DevOps at its core is based around increasing collaboration between development and operations, which has the effect of not only increasing the frequency of releasing updates into production, but also the reliability of said updates.

## Why DevOps?
I chose to pursue a career in this field as It allows you to be involved not only in the software development but also the infrastructure management of a business’s services. Additionally, I feel that in this role I would be able to not only utilise my current skills gained throughout my education and training at Sparta, but also develop on my personal and technical skills, whilst being able to tackle a wide range of challenging tasks within a company.
